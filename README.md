# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

- The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier. We are predicting whether or not loan applicants will be successful if they are given the loan. We have been given an CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding over the years. 

## Results

- Data Preprocessing
    - The target variable in our analysis is "IS_SUCCESSFUL"
    - The feature variables in our analysis are Application Type, Affiliation, Classification, Use Case, Organization, Status, Income Amount, Special Considerations, and Ask Amount.
    - The variables that are not considered to be feature or target variables are "EIN" and Name.
- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
  - I used 3 layers in the fuction.
  - I was not able to achieve the target performance
  - When optimizing the model, I removed Status and Special Considerations as features. This increased the accuracy by 1%.
